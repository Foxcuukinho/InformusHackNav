Analyze the text: "<text>"

A topic/information is defined by its meaning, and can be:

- a fact
- a question

If the text contains only one topic, return ONLY: { "topics": [] }

If the text contains two or more topics, identify and separate each one, then return ONLY a JSON like this, with no extra text: { "topics": [ "First topic here", "Second topic here" ] }

Examples:

"Aliens built the pyramids, but they don't know!" → { "topics": [ "Aliens built the pyramids", "They don't know about it" ] }

"Aliens built the pyramids." → { "topics": [] }
